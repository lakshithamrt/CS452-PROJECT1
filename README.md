CS452-PROJECT1
==============

My project is modeling an oil release from deep water based on particle system.
Still project is in process. So far this code gives a animation of a particle fountain,
Which is to be modified with different dynamics.
This might not work in opengl versions before 4.0, since I've used layout qualifiers in vertex shader.
